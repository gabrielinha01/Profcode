        I don't really know what comes next
        I'm just doing my best, even though
        I'm so stressed out
        Everything just feels like a test
        That I fail so depressed
        When I can't seem to get out
        
        But something deep inside won't let me quit
        I swear that I'm inspired by all this shit
        Tell me that I can't and I won't
        That's what guides me the most
        Fuck your lies, I'll do what I want!
      
        I'm inspired by thirst
        I'm inspired by worth
        I desire your worst
        So you can just hide while I work
        I ain't tired you first
        I'll write a second, third verse
        About the lies you go disperse
        You never did shit I know it hurts
       
        Something deep inside won't let me quit
        I swear that I'm inspired by all this shit
        Tell me that I can't and I won't
        That's what guides me the most
        Fuck your lies, I'll do what I want!

        They call me a God, they call me a God
        They call me a God, they call me a God
        Let's go

        I'm about to go off like a weapon
        Fueled to the top, got a filled up engine (let's go)
        In my thoughts obsession, I will not stop
        No I'm never second guessing (that's right)
        I got a God complex
        Haters love to hate, but I never feel pressed
        Got a lot on my plate but I never get stressed
        I'll take all the pressure like I'm acing this test
        Oh, tear it up like I'm Jason
        I see the world like it's ready for the taking (that's right)
        I see this place like a game I'm playing
        Straight to the bank to collect my payments (let's go)
        No negotiations
        It's my way I was born impatient (okay)
        And like a damn freemason
        I'll run this nation

        They call me a God, they call me a God
        They call me a God, they call me a God, oh

        I don't know how to stop (that's right)
        I just go till I drop (okay)
        Whether it's working or it's shots (that's right)
        Give all that I got (oh)
        You can watch me work in my element
        Anyone in the way is irrelevant
        You wanna cross me cool not intelligent
        'Cause I don't forget shit like an elephant (that's right)

        Go ahead and tempt me
        Put it on the line and you'll come up empty (let's go)
        If I got time I'm deadly
        Never caught off guard no I'm always ready (oh)
        I got a hand real steady
        Look me in the eye and you'll see no Hessy (no Hessy)
        About to get real messy
        I'll put you in a grave six feet like Kenny

        They call me a God, they call me a God
        They call me a God, they call me a God

        I can feel the blood creeping up from the heathens
        Got will, got fight, got pride, got reason
        If they wanna go eat, then you know I'm gonna feed ’em
        If you coming for me, hope you’re ready for a demon

        I got eyes in the back of my head I'm seeing
        Take me for granted and you know I'm leaving
        I'ma take what’s mine with the webs I'm weaving
        I can take this crowd from seeing to believing

        Gotta taste for blood and my tongue keeps bleeding
        From the words I spit so sharp, so freezing
        So cold behold frost bite they feeling
        I can tear you apart or I can go heal’em

        Don’t believe in fate, don’t believe in ceilings
        I just need a taste and my mind starts peeling
        I don’t pace myself, I grind, no kneeling
        Got lust for change, I just love the feeling

        And I ain’t gonna give up
        Got too little time I'ma live up
        Head down push forward through the tough times
        'Cause anything worth doing is a tough climb

        I'ma, live life for the fight yea I'm here to get it
        I got drive, got sight, always have a vision
        I don’t lie at night, I be in my feelings
        I'ma be fine, need time and I’ll soon be winning

        I live life for the fight yea I'm here to get it
